# Juggling Analogy

I'm a juggler, and each of you (i.e., a student) is represented by a ball.
My job is to keep all the balls in the air at any given point in time, and to sustain this state for an arbitrarily long period of time.

The ball representing "you" is "in the air" if you are able to productive, working independently (this includes reading, implementing, running experiments, writing, etc.).
The ball representing "you" is "on the ground" if you're blocked by something.
My goal is to help you become unblocked.
In the juggling analogy, that's me catching the ball and tossing it up again.

For example, a canonical interaction pattern might be that we meet, discuss experiments to run (catch the ball and toss it up), and then you go off to run those experiments (ball is in the air).
Sometimes the ball is in the air for a long time (e.g., you have a complex implementation to work on).
Sometimes the ball is in the air for only a short time (e.g., you're running a quick experiment and will be back with results soon).

In the analogy, the gravitational constant _g_ quantifies how long your ball should be up in the air, based on the force applied when tossing the ball.
For example, I would expect Ph.D. students to operate in low _g_, that is, they're able to work independently for long periods of time.
For a Ph.D. student nearing graduation, it would not be weird to not have interactions for weeks
(e.g., "I'm working on those experiments we discussed, and then writing up the results. Everything is proceeding as planned. Nothing to report, I'll let you know when I'm done with Chapter 4.")

In the analogy, the force applied during the toss is characterized by the planning horizon, and is independent of _g_.
For example, we could be executing on a paper submission due in a month, so despite a Ph.D. student having a low _g_, since we're planning incrementally, we might have frequent iteractions (i.e., lots of small tosses, ball coming back down again quickly).
At one extreme, the iteraction cycle might be on the order of minutes (e.g., I just rewrote the intro to the draft, let me know what you think).
